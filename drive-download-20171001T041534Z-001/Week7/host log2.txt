CS35L Assignment 7 Laboratory Log

1. Obtain the Ubuntu CD and place it into the computer. For this lab, I used 
the UCLA Seasnet computers (Dell). Because the Seasnet Linux Server lnxsrv 
does not allow admin commands like ssh and sudo, which is required for this 
lab, you dual boot the machine to get the Ubuntu OS. 

2. Shut down the computer and restart. Once the Dell logo shows up, press the 
F12 button. The BIOS screen options should show up. Select tge option to 
boot from CD, and then press Enter. Now, wait for Ubuntu to boot up. Once it 
is finished booting up, click on 'Try Ubuntu' and wait for it to load. Now 
you are in the Ubuntu OS. 

3. Open up the terminal. The shortcut keystroke to open the terminal is 
Ctrl-Alt-T. Run the following command to see what is installed: 
$ dpkg --get-selections | grep openssh
This should output: 
openssh-client 	install

Notice that we still need the openssh-server to be installed. To install the 
openssh-server, type this command: 
$ sudo apt-get install openssh-server
Press Y to continue, and once openssh-server is installed, then type the 
dpkg command again to confirm you have installed openssh-server: 
$ dpkg --get-selections | grep openssh
This should output: 
openssh-client install
openssh-server install
openssh-sftp-server install

Now we have both the openssh-client and openssh-server. We are good to go. 

4. Generate a key using the following command: 
$ ssh-keygen
(Then I set the passphrase to be memes)
memes
memes

Then, you should see a randomart image RSA 2048, something along the lines of 
that.

To get the public key: 
$ cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
To get the private key: 
$ cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa id_rsa.pub

5. Add users and set password. I set the home directory to be kyle and 
the username to be kw: 
$ sudo useradd -d /home/kyle -m kw
$ sudo passwd
memes1
memes1 
That is, I set the passphrase for username kw to be memes1. 

6. Change directory to the home directory name kyle: 
$ cd /home/kyle
$ sudo mkdir .ssh
$ sudo chown -R kw .ssh (change ownership. client owner of the file)
$ sudo chmod 700 .ssh

7. Check the server IP address: 
$ ipconfig

The IP address of the server is the inet address, which outputted 
10.97.85.46. 



cd /home/kyle
sudo mkdir .ssh
sudo chown -R kw .ssh (change ownership to client, username kw to be 
owner of the file)
sudo chmod 700 .ssh
(read write execute to user owner and nothing to group and all others)

ifconfig for IP address (inet adddress: 10.97.85.46)

ps -aux | grep firefox
Have client run the firefox 
kw 28121 12.7 2.8 990876 229780 pts/2 Sl+ 16:06 0:02 /usr/lib/firefox/firefox

see what user kw is running 
ps -aux | grep kw
