    Here are suggestions if you're
    interested in the course but are neither enrolled nor on the waiting list.
    <ul>
     <li>
       Read <a href='http://web.cs.ucla.edu/classes/enroll/'>Enrollment in
	 Computer Science Classes</a> and follow its advice.</li>
     <li>
       Any PTEs are not typically given out until the end of the second week,
       to make sure that enough resources are available.
       You can try coming to classes before then.
       Sign up on any attendance sheet that is being passed around.</li>
