1. Grab file
 a.Download coreutils-7.6 to my home directory using:
 	 wget ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/coreutils/coreutils-7.6.tar.gz

 b.Untar and Unzip it using:
       	tar â€“xzvf coreutils-7.6.tar.gz 

2.Compile and install your copy of Coreutils into a temporary directory of your own. Note any problems you run into.
 a.create a directory in the current working directory ~/lab3/coreutilsInstall
	 mkdir coreutilsInstall
 b.configure the file and use the prefix flag so that when everything is done, it is put into the designated directory
 	  cd ./coreutils-7.6
 	  ./configure --prefix=/u/eng/class/classefa/lab3/coreutilsInstall
 c.compile the file
 	   make   
	   make install

3.Reproduce the bug on your machine with the unmodified version of coreutils.
 a.generate the problematic locale
 	    export LC_ALL='en_US.UTF-8'
 b. reporduce the problem
    	    cd ..
	    cd ./coreutilsInstall/bin
	    ./ls -l /bin/bash
 the output gives us: -rwxr-xr-x 1 root root 960632 2017-08-03 06:36 /bin/bash

4.Use Emacs or Vim to apply Brady's patch.
 a.create a patch that needs to be patched and copy the content on the webpage into it
 	  vim patch_file
	  //make copy from web page and change all directories in patch to ./ls.c
	  ZZ
 b.go to the folder
      	 cd ../../coreutils-7.6/scr
 c.apply the patch to the file
 	 patch -p0 < patch_file
  -p0: strip the smallest prefix containing 0 keading slashes from each file name found in the patch.
  after checking, the file is changed successfully

5.Type the command make at the top level of your source tree, so that you build (but do not install) the fixed version.
 a.go back to the top level and remake it
      	   cd ..
	   make
6.Make sure your change fixes the bug, by testing that the modified ls works on your test case and that the installed ls doesn't. Test on a file that has been recently modified, and on a file that is at least a year old. You can use the touch command to artficially mark a file as being a year old.
 a.go back to our lab folder and run the installed ls
      cd ..
      ./coreutilsInstall/bin/ls -l ./coreutils-7.6.tar.gz
this gives us: -rw-r--r-- 1 classefa class 10014650 2017-10-23 13:13 ./coreutils-7.6.tar.gz

 b. run the modified ls
      ./coreutils-7.6/src/ls -l ./coreutils-7.6.tar.gz
this gives us: -rw-r--r-- 1 classefa class 10014650 Oct 23 13:13 ./coreutils-7.6.tar.gz

 c. make a file at least a year old by touching
      touch -t 0808080000 coreutils-7.6.tar.gz
 d. test the installed ls
      ./coreutilsInstall/bin/ls	-l ./coreutils-7.6.tar.gz
this gives us: -rw-r--r-- 1 classefa class 10014650 2008-08-08 00:00 ./coreutils-7.6.tar.gz
 e. test the modified ls
      ./coreutils-7.6/src/ls -l ./coreutils-7.6.tar.gz
this gives us: -rw-r--r-- 1 classefa class 10014650 Aug  8  2008 ./coreutils-7.6.tar.gz

we can see that the modified version will always give us the correct answer.
